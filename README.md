# BootCam-Prog
Read an integer and a list of positive integers (>0) from the user. 
You can decide on the list to be in any format.
Find all pairs of numbers in the list that their sum is equal to the first number. 
Print out a formatted list of the pairs.
For example: First number: 12 The list: 3, 10, 4, 9, 8, 7, 4. You have to find all pairs of numbers that add up to 12 (e.g. 3+9=12 ; 8+4=12)  When receiving the input from user, you would allow duplicates. When finding the pairs, duplicates such as [6,6] are not considered. Moreover [4,8] or [8,4] would be considered as a single pair.
